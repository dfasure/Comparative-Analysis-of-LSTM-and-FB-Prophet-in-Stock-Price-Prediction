# Comparative-Analysis-of-LSTM-and-FB-Prophet-in-Stock-Price-Prediction

This project is a comparative analysis of the simplicity and performance of Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and FB-Prophet model in the prediction of stock prices. In this analysis, the simplicity and accuracy of these models are evaluated primarily using the default arguments of the models.
"yfinance" was used to load historical data of Apple stocks over 22years. This data was model separately using Prophet and LSTM and the result from each model was compared. When it comes to simplicity, the Prophet model was a lot easier to implement, when compared with the LSTM.  With LSTM, it was observed that changing the number of epoch significantly influenced the performance of the model, an this relationship between the number of epoch and performance is not always linear. For the Prophet model, changing any of the defualt arguments did not result in any significant change to the performance of the model.
